# Customer_behavior_analysis
A data analysis and visualization project that explores customer behavior and sales patterns using structured datasets, interactive dashboards, and actionable insights using Python, sql and power BI.

📊 Data Analytics Project: Customer Behavior & Sales Analysis
--
📌 Overview
-
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI.
The goal is to analyze customer behavior and sales data to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable business insights through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, SQL querying, and interactive dashboards.

This repository is suitable for portfolio, academic, and entry-level data analyst roles.

📂 Dataset
-
The dataset contains customer and sales-related information such as:

1.Customer details

2.Order data

3.Purchase amounts

4.Dates and order status

Data was initially loaded and explored using Python, then stored and queried in PostgreSQL for analysis.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
-
-Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

-PostgreSQL (SQL queries)

-Power BI (Dashboard & visualization)

-Jupyter Notebook 

-SQLAlchemy (Python–PostgreSQL connection)

🔍 Project Workflow / Steps
-
1️⃣ Data Loading

Imported raw dataset into Python using Pandas

Verified data structure, data types, and basic statistics

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and outliers

Identified missing values and inconsistencies

Generated summary statistics and visualizations

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values (median/mean replacement where required)

Removed duplicates

Corrected data types (dates, numerical columns)

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL

Executed SQL queries to:

Analyze total and monthly sales

Identify top-performing customers

Track order status and cancellations

Answer business-focused questions

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to PostgreSQL / cleaned dataset

Built an interactive dashboard with:

-Sales trends

-Customer behavior insights

-KPIs and summary metrics

-Filters for dynamic analysis

📊 Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

-Clear KPIs for sales and orders

-Time-based trend analysis

-Customer segmentation insights

-Easy-to-understand visual storytelling

📌 Dashboard File: Included in the repository (.pbix)
